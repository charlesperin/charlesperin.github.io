	<h3>I am actively recruiting students</h3>
	<p>If you are considering applying for graduate studies and interesting in working with me on topics related to information visualization and human-computer interaction, then please give the prospective students section below a read before contacting me.</p>

	<header class="major"><h2>Prospective Students</h2></header>
	
<p>
I am actively seeking talented MSc and PhD researchers for projects in the area of interactive data visualization, human-computer interaction, ubiquitous computing and/or visual data science.
</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b><br />
    Do not expect a response if you send me a completely generic email. Please take the time to finish reading this page, and have a look some of at my recent <a href="./../research"> research and publications</a>.
</p>

<p>
  You wil work directly with me in a collaborative and interdisciplinary environment. I am open to any research idea related to my expertise and interests, and I welcome applicants from a wide range of disciplines, including Computer Science, Engineering, Design, and Cognitive Science. I strongly encourage applicants with multi- and inter-disciplinary backgrounds. I am also very interested in co-supervising across departments, and faculties.
  To inquire, simply send me an email at <a href="mailto:cperin@uvic.ca">cperin@uvic.ca</a> with:
  <ul class="default">
      <li>
        a subject header that includes "Prospective Student" and your name
      </li>
      <li>
        your CV
      </li>
      <li>
        A brief outline of research interests, including information about the project you would be interested in working on (either something I am working on or a topic of your own choice)
      </li>
      <li>
        A short paragraph explaining why you would like to work with me (a bit more elaborated than "because you are awesome")
      </li>
      <li>
        Your favourite sport (to show that you have read this document)
      </li>
      <li>
        A document you have written. This can be a dissertation, a course project report, a technical report, a conference paper, etc..
      </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
  There are some requirements you need to meet to work with me.
  <ul class="default">
      <li>
          You need to be a student at the University of Victoria. Please consult our <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/graduatestudies/admissions/admissions/index.php" title="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Graduate Studies Admissions</a> website for the administrative part.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should be familiar with my research interests and areas.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should be passionate about conducting research with me. I am looking for enthusiastic students.
      </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Research Interests</h3>

<p>
  My interests and expertise include personal visualization, sports visualization, visualization literacy, health visualization, physical and tangible visualization, visualization of open source data and visualization on public and semi-public displays. I am particularly interested in researching tools help people design visualizations of their own data for self-reflection and sharing; as well as ubiquitous visualization in the home.
</p>

<p>
  Most of my research projects are design-centred, including design studies, design space explorations, and tasks and requirements analysis. Projects can also be more technology-centered, with a focus on implementation and technology. Depending on the project, they can involve qualitative and/or quantitative evaluations.
</p>


<h3 id="topics">Topics</h3>

There are a number of topics I am interested in working on, however this list is very much non0exhaustive and what I have on top of my head as I write this page. I am looking for students who can have their own ideas and are passionate about particular research projects.

<p>
    Topics of interest include:

    <ul class="default">

        <li>
            Storytelling and narrative style with relatable visualizations.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tools for authoring and sharing personal visualizations.
        </li>
        <li>
            Geographical visualization, visualization for the digital humanities, visualization of open-data, sports visualization, visualization for citizen-science.
        </li>
        <li>
            Physical representation of data, in particular in a personal environment like a home.
        </li>
        <li>
            Perceptual and cognitive principles for visualization (e.g., perception of uncertainty, non-visual perception of data).
        </li>
        <li>
            Embedded / Situated Visualization on small devices, visualization on smartphones and smart-watches, and visualization with Augmented / Virtual Reality technologies.
        </li>
        <li>
            Visualization in public / semi-public contexts, and the design of interactions for multi-touch collaborative environments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Physical visualization of data streams (actuated physical visualizations).
        </li>
        <li>
            Post-WIMP interaction paradigms for visualization.
        </li>
    </ul>
