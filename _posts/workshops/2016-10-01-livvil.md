description: "A growing number of visualization tools are now publicly released on the Web. While this has many benefits, such as reaching more users without any installation time or procedure, it is often unclear how those tools are being used. The most common method to remotely observe usage is remote logging through a web server. Analyzing recorded logs has already been successful to improve the usability of tools, assess the performance of users and even to enrich the user interface with histories or logs visualizations. However, from our own practice of recording and analyzing logs, we have found a lack of methodology to support this process and use the results consistently. Our goal is to raise awareness of the potential of logging to improve visualization tools and their evaluation, as well as paving the way for a long term research agenda on the use of logs in Information visualization."
