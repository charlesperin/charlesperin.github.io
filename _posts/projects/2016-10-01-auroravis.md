description: "The Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights is a phenomenon that has fascinated people throughout history. The AuroraMAX outreach initiative provides a collection of time-lapse videos of the night sky captured by a camera at Yellowknife in Canada. We have generated large-scale digital prints from a sequence of photographs of the northern sky taken over the course of one night. Each image is aggregated across time creating visually appealing and intriguing images – or Keograms – that visualize Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) activity as well as interesting movements of clouds and stars that occurred that night. We presented some of these keograms at the IEEE VIS '16 Arts Program. We also created an interactive visualization of the Keograms that we exhibited at the local Beakerhead art-science festival. We report on the design of the interface and our experience in our ISS '16 Immersive Analytics workshop abstract."
