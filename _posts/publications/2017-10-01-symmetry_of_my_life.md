description: "I present an autobiographical visualization of the past 18 months of my life that shows work and personal activities, steps, floors, emails, SVN commits, and contextual annotations. The spiral layout makes both cyclical and symmetrical patterns emerge. The resulting autobiographical visualization makes it possible to both reminisce and share personal stories."
