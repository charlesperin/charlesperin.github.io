description: "Members understanding the organization of a community is useful for any community. Correspondingly this applies to researchers involved in the Infovis community. We present Who Rules Infovis?, a visualization designed to be a static infographic showing the temporal evolution of the internal organization of the Infovis conference track. It shows all persons who have been a chair or in a related committee over the past 20 years and makes it more possible to understand the internal organization of the community."

			If you are interested in the data, I used two datasets to generate the poster.
			</p>

			<p>
			The first one is a filtered snapshot of the <a href="http://www.vispubdata.org/site/vispubdata/">vispubdata</a> dataset. You can <a href="/data/2015_who_rules_infovis_IEEE VIS papers 1990-2014-filtered.csv">download the "publications" file here</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
			The second file contains the roles people took over the years. This file was manually created with some data retrieved from the physical proceedings, thus may not be 100% accurate. You can <a href="/data/2015_who_rules_infovis_infovis_people_all.csv">download the "roles" file here</a>. And feel free to let me know if you find any mistake in it!
