description: "Members understanding the organization of a community is useful for any community. Correspondingly this applies to researchers involved in the Infovis community. We present Who Rules Infovis?, a visualization designed to be a static infographic showing the temporal evolution of the internal organization of the Infovis conference track. It shows all persons who have been a chair or in a related committee over the past 20 years and makes it more possible to understand the internal organization of the community."
