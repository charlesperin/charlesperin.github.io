description: "With the emergence of quantified-self, smart devices, Internet of Things and ubiquitous robotics, we envision new opportunities to create dynamic embedded physicalizations. In particular, we see new challenges arising in the context of personal and casual physicalizations at home. In this paper, we discuss the research directions and potential benefits of dynamic embedded physicalizations in the residential context, or Embedded Personal Physicalizations.."
