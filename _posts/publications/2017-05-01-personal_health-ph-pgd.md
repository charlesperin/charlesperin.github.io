description: "While patients increasing willingness to collect their personal health data portends improvements in the individualization of health care, making it possible for the health care providers to effectively act upon these personal data collections poses its own challenges. In this paper, we discuss the challenges we are facing as we work towards the creation of tools to help patients present this data to their care givers."
