description_short: "We have generated large-scale digital prints from a sequence of photographs of the northern sky taken over the course of one night. Each image is aggregated across time creating visually appealing and intriguing images – or Keograms – that visualize Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) activity as well as interesting movements of clouds and stars that occurred that night."
