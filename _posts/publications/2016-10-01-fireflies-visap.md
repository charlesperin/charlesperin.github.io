description_short: "Fireflies is a bio-inspired visualization using animal swarming behaviour and plant phyllotaxis. We applied Fireflies to a Canadian attitudinal survey on HIV/AIDS, using motion to depict participants' comfort levels concerning HIV+ people. The bio-inspired visual properties of Fireflies meld into an expressive and engaging representation of sensitive data."
