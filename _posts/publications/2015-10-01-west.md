description: "WESt is a visualization for surgery waiting times applied to the province of British Columbia (BC) in Canada. This project is motivated by the long waiting time for surgeries in BC, which has the potential to put patients in danger and put extra pressure on clinicians [2]. WESt helps patients select a hospital and a physician, and to explore their options to get their surgery as soon as possible."
