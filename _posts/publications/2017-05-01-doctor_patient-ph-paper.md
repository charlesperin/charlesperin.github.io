description: "We provide an integrated view of patients' and clinicians' perspectives on the communication challenges faced when patients present their medical issues to the clinicians. By combining the results of a literature review from both the HCI and medical literature with the results of clinician interviews explicitly about in-clinic communication issues, we are able to offer a more complete picture of these crucial in-clinic communication challenges. We discuss similarities and subtle but important differences between patients' and clinicians' perspectives. While patients and clinicians are often talking about the same issue, we found that they differ considerably in opinion and attitude. Drawing upon these subtle yet significant differences and ideas raised by the interviewed clinicians, we offer research suggestions for the design of future in-clinic communication tools."
