One section on my thoughts about the need to come from a famous, US university -> again,what matters most is your number of publications. Then of course when you have 5 or 6 years to publish during your PhD its longer than 3 years.

Talk about what you have control over, and what you don't.
Do a kind of visualization that shows how many job applications you send, how many people apply for each, with some clear overlap across positions, then the different stages of the selection process, from those who are filtered out administratively (e.g., completely different discipline or incomplete applications), to fit to the topic, to number of publications. This creates a long list of maybe a few dozens participants.
Then search committee goes through these applications, each university has its own process, and applications are discussed to create a short list. This can take a few weeks. At this point they might look at reference letters. If they do, it's a great deal. Very, very important. Makes the difference.
Then short list is invited to interview, usually 2 to 4, but 3 is a very common number. And that's where you make the difference.
