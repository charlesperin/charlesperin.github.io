      </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Research Interests</h3>

<p>
  My interests and expertise include personal visualization, sports visualization, visualization literacy, health visualization, physical and tangible visualization, visualization of open source data and visualization on public and semi-public displays. I am particularly interested in researching tools help people design visualizations of their own data for self-reflection and sharing; as well as ubiquitous visualization in the home.
</p>

<p>
  Most of my research projects are design-centred, including design studies, design space explorations, and tasks and requirements analysis. Projects can also be more technology-centered, with a focus on implementation and technology. Depending on the project, they can involve qualitative and/or quantitative evaluations.
