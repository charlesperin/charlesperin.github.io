    abstract = {{This article presents R2S2, a hybrid visualization technique as an intermediate step between Rank Chart and Slope Graph to better understand and analyze team evolutions during soccer championships. Currently used rank tables for soccer are relative (ranked-based) and do not convey the absolute difference between teams. R2S2 provides a way to visualize these differences using the Slope Graph technique (value-based). By interactively setting the parameters of R2S2, we make the distance between teams appear, minimizing the overlaps caused by the Slope Graph technique.}},
