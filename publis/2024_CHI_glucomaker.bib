abstract = {Millions of individuals with diabetes use glucose monitors to track blood sugar levels. Research shows that such individuals seek to customize different aspects of their interactions with these devices, including how they engage with, decorate, and wear them. However, it remains challenging to tailor both device form and function to accommodate individual needs. To address this challenge, we introduce GlucoMaker, a system for collaboratively customizing physical design aspects of glucose monitors. Prior to designing GlucoMaker, we conducted a prototyping and focus group study to understand customization preferences and collaboration benefits. GlucoMaker provides individuals with the ability to a) select monitor form and function preferences, b) alter predefined and downloadable digital model files, c) receive feedback on monitor designs from stakeholders, and d) learn technical design aspects. We further demonstrate the versatility and design space of GlucoMaker with three examples of different form and function use cases.},
