abstract={ Personal affective physicalization is the process by which individuals express emotions through tangible forms to record, reflect on, and communicate. Yet such physical data representations can be challenging to design due to the abstract nature of emotions. Given the shown potential of AI in detecting emotion and assisting design, we explore opportunities in AI-assisted design of personal affective physicalization using a research-through-design method. We developed PhEmotion, a tool for embedding LLM-extracted emotion values from human–AI conversations into the parametric design of physical artifacts. A lab study was conducted with 14 participants creating these artifacts based on their personal emotions, with and without AI support. We observed nuances and variations in participants’ creative strategies, meaning-making processes, and their perceptions of AI support in this context. We found key tensions in AI–human cocreation that provide a nuanced agenda for future research in AI-assisted personal affective physicalization. },
