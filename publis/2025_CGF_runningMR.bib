abstract = {Abstract We investigate the use of mixed reality visualisations to help pace tracking for interval running. We introduce three immersive visual designs to support pace tracking. Our designs leverage two properties afforded by mixed reality environments to display information: the space in front of the user and the physical environment to embed pace visualisation. In this paper, we report on the first design exploration and controlled study of mixed reality technology to support pacing tracking during interval running on an outdoor running track. Our results show that mixed reality and immersive visualisation designs for interval training offer a viable option to help runners (a) maintain regular pace, (b) maintain running flow, and (c) reduce mental task load.},
